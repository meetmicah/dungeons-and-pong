## Rules

Normal ping pong rules apply unless these rules overwrite them.

### Rolling the Die
Hitting your opponent's die during regular play is one of the primary goals of the game. The die will roll to reveal a number or a "draw". If the die rolls a "draw", the offending team draws a card from the deck and casts the spell on the card. ([See The Cards](cards.md)). If the die rolls a number, then the offending team gains that number of points, and also draws a card from the deck.

The dice can be hit at any time during regular play of the game, even on a serve. 

If a team topples their own die during regular play, it counts against them, awarding the resulting roll to the opposing team. **Warning:** The [I Meant Todd Tooth Hat](cards.md#eye-mint-todd-tooth-hat) card dilutes this penalty.

The die are to be placed 16 inches (roughly the length of a regulation-sized paddle) from the net on either side.

### Passing
Passing is the act of batting the ball to your teammate if it is their turn to return the volley. It is basically seen as the "Alley-Oop" of Dungeons and Pong.

A player who has the ball passed to them may not "slam" the ball across the net. If they do, the point is awarded to the opposing team. 

### Hitting the net during play
If the ball hits the net during normal play and crosses to the other side, it still counts, so long as it is not during a serve.
