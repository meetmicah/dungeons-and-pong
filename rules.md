## Rules

Normal ping pong rules apply unless these rules overwrite them.

[Printable Rules](DungeonsPongRules.pdf)

### Rolling the Die
* Hitting your opponent's die during regular play is one of the primary goals of the game. The stand will topple and the die will roll to reveal a number. The offending team receives the number of points specified on the die AND draws a card from the deck and casts the spell on the card. ([See The Cards](cards.md)).
* The dice can be hit at any time during regular play of the game, even on a serve.
* If a team topples their own die during regular play, it counts against them, awarding the resulting roll to the opposing team. **Warning:** The [Eye Meant Todd Tooth Hat](cards.md#eye-mint-todd-tooth-hat) card reverses this penalty.
* The die are to be placed 16 inches from the net on either side.

### Passing
* Passing is the act of batting the ball to your teammate if it is their turn to return the volley. It is basically seen as the "Alley-Oop" of Dungeons and Pong.
* A player who has the ball passed to them may not "slam" the ball across the net. If they do, the point is awarded to the opposing team.

### Multi-Pass
* The "multi-pass" is essentially hitting the ball more than once in order to gain control of the ball to pass or hit back over the net.
* There must be an amount of "sufficient panic" involved in the multi-pass. Basically, the player may not dribble the ball to gain a better advantage.

### Hitting the net during play
* If the ball hits the net during normal play and crosses to the other side, it still counts, so long as it is not during a serve.

### Serving
* The serve must cross diagonally to the opposite side of the table. If it does not that is a let.
* If the serve hits the net but still hits the table on the other side that is also a let.
* If the server has 3 lets in a row the serving team loses 1 point.

### Paddles or Hands or Whatever
* The ball is still considered "live" until it hits the floor or table on the returning team's side.
* A player can use either the paddle or their hand or their leg or head or whatever body part to hit the ball.

### Put Some Effort Into It
* If the ball is dead and the receiving team is throwing the ball back to the serving team and the ball hits the net and never makes it to the serving team's side of the table, the receiving team loses 1 point for lack of effort.
